\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  In the late sixties, Jack Schwartz, a renowned professor of mathematics at the Courant Institute for
Mathematical Sciences in New York, developed a very high level programming language called
\textsc{Setl} 
\cite{schwartz:1970, setl86}.  The most distinguishing feature of this language is the
support it offers for sets and lists.   As set theory is the language of mathematics, many mathematical
algorithms that are formulated in terms of set theory have a very straightforward implementation in
\textsc{Setl}. 

Unfortunately, at the time of its invention, \textsc{Setl} did not get the attention that it deserved.
One of the main reasons was that \textsc{Setl} is an interpreted language and in the early days of
computer science, the run time overhead of an interpreter loop was not yet affordable.  More than
forty years after the first conception of \textsc{Setl}, the efficiency of computers has changed
dramatically and for many applications, the run time efficiency of a languange is no
longer as important as it once was.  After all, 
modern scripting languages like Python \cite{vanRossum:95} or Ruby \cite{flanagan:2008}
are all interpreted and noticeably slower than compiled languages like \texttt{C}, but this
fact hasn't impeded their success. 

While teaching at the Baden-W\"urttemberg Corporate State University,  the first author had used
\textsc{Setl2} \cite{snyder90b} for several years in a number of introductory computer science
courses.  He had noticed that the adoption of \textsc{Setl} had made the abstract concepts of set theory
more accessible to the students.   Nevertheless, as the original version of
\textsc{Setl} is more than forty years old, it has a number of shortcomings.  
One minor issue is the fact that the syntax of \textsc{Setl} is quite dated and has proven difficult to
master  for students that are mainly acquainted with \texttt{C} and \textsl{Java}.
Furthermore,  \textsc{Setl} lacks any immediate support for first order terms.  Therefore, 
\textsc{Setl} has been extended into the new language \textsc{SetlX}.  The main features that have
been changed or added are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsc{SetlX} supports terms in a way similar to the language \textsl{Prolog}.  In
      particular, \textsc{SetlX} supports matching.  This makes \textsc{SetlX} well suited 
      for symbolic computations.
\item \textsc{SetlX} supports several ideas from functional programming.  In particular,
      functions can be used as a primitive data type.  Furthermore, \textsc{SetlX}
      supports \emph{closures} and the \emph{memoization} of functions.
\item \textsc{SetlX} has support for regular expressions.
\item \textsc{SetlX} provides a limited way of backtracking.
\item \textsc{SetlX} supports object oriented programming concepts.
\item \textsc{SetlX} provides a small set of graphical primitives that support
      the animation of algorithms.
\item \textsc{SetlX} provides a plotting library that can be used graph functions or to draw scatter plots.
\item Lastly, while \textsc{Setl} has a syntax that is reminiscent of Algol,
      \textsc{SetlX} has a syntax that is more akin to languages like \texttt{C} or
      \textsl{Java}.  
\end{itemize}
The language \textsc{SetlX} has been implemented by Tom Herrmann as part of his student
research project.  He still continues to supervise the addition of new features.
Furthermore, Markus Jagiella, Patrick Robinson, Arne Röcke, and Fabian Wohriska 
have added various functionalities to the \textsc{SetlX} interpreter.
